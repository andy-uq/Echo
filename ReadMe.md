# Echo - A space-orientated economy simulation

Echo is inspired by other such simulations like [Minecraft](http://www.minecraft.net/), [Dwarven Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/) and borrows heavily from [EVE](http://www.eveonline.com/).

This is a work-in-progress and is not yet even in an alpha stage.
